Year 8 Scratch Breakout (Arkanoid) – Marking guide (student-friendly)

You are aiming to include Core features first, then add Secure and Stretch.

CORE (expected)
- Paddle moves smoothly and stays on screen
- Ball moves and bounces correctly
- Bricks disappear when hit
- Score works
- Lose a life when the ball falls off the bottom
- Clear win/lose message

SECURE (strong)
- Start screen with instructions
- Reset/restart button or green-flag restart
- Different brick rows worth different points OR different colours
- Sound effects (bounce / brick break / life lost)
- Lives displayed on screen

STRETCH (top end)
- Levels (new brick layout, faster ball, etc.)
- Power-ups (wider paddle, multi-ball, slow-motion)
- Combo / multiplier scoring
- Simple high score system (stored while the project is open)
- Polished art/theme and readable UI
